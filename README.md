### webscrapper to find videos online with spanish language options

the idea came to be when i wanted to find movies online that had spanish audio optinons (having only Amazon and too cheap to pay for Disney+/Netflix)
there is advanced search for books https://www.amazon.com/advanced-search/books
but for Prime Video I couldn't find any such advnaced options where I could have better filtering by language
Besdies, if it was easy to search, it would undermine the motivation and need for this project. so let's start hacking!

### plan

use this site as a list to start scraping from 
https://www.justwatch.com/us/provider/amazon-prime-video/movies
use some basic python webscraping packages

voila!
